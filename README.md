🚀 Understanding Methods in Java with Packages! 📂

Methods are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. In Java, organizing methods inside different packages (folders) improves code structure, making it more modular and scalable.

📝 No Return Type & No Parameters Method
The add() method inside the Calculator class:
* Does not return any value (void return type).
* Does not take any parameters (fixed values inside the method).
* Performs addition and prints the result.

Here’s a simple Java program demonstrating:
 ✅ Method with no return type and no parameters
 ✅ Calling a method from a different package

🔥 What Are Methods in Java?
✔ A method is a block of code that performs a task
 ✔ It improves code reusability – Write once, use multiple times
 ✔ Enhances readability & maintainability

📌 Why Use Methods?
 ✅ Avoids code repetition
 ✅ Easy debugging & modification
 ✅ Improves program structure

🚀 Understanding Methods in Java: No Return Type with Parameters.
 
In Java, methods help in code reusability and modular programming. Below is a simple example demonstrating a method with parameters and no return type:

🔹 add(float x, float y) Method:

 ✅ Accepts two float parameters and performs addition.
 ✅ Uses void return type, meaning it does not return any value but prints the result directly.

🔹 How It Works:

 ✅ We create an object of the Calculator class.
 ✅ We pass values (25.0f, 30.0f) as arguments while calling the add() method.
 ✅ The method processes the values and prints Sum = 55.0.

Key Takeaways:
 ✅ Methods improve code reusability by avoiding repetition.
 ✅ Parameters allow flexibility in passing different values dynamically.
 ✅ Void return type executes an operation without returning a result.
 ✅ Encapsulation of logic makes the program structured and easy to maintain.


🚀 Understanding Java Methods: No Parameter with Return Type!

Methods in Java enhance code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. In this example, we define a method that does not take parameters but returns a value after performing an operation.

🔹 How It Works:

 ✅ The Calculator class contains an add() method that initializes two integers (a = 400, b = 100), adds them, and returns the result.
 ✅ In the Callapp class, we create an object of Calculator and call the add() method.
 ✅ The result is stored in a variable and printed to the console.

Key Takeaways:

 ✅ No parameters: The method does not require inputs when called.
 ✅ Return type: The method returns an integer value after performing the addition.
 ✅ Encapsulation: The logic is encapsulated within the method, making the code structured and reusable.

🚀 Java Program – Method with Parameters and Return Type!

In Java, methods with parameters and return types allow us to pass values to a method, perform operations, and return the result. This improves code reusability and modularity.

📌 Explanation of the Code:

✅ Method with Parameters and Return Type:
add(int a, int b) accepts two integers as parameters.
It returns the sum of a and b using return a + b;.
✅ Calling the Method:
The method is called using c.add(a, b);, and the returned result is stored in result.
Finally, System.out.println("Sum = " + result); prints the result.

💡 Benefits of Using Methods with Parameters and Return Type

✔ Code Reusability – The method can be used multiple times with different values
 ✔ Encapsulation – Keeps logic separate and improves maintainability
 ✔ Flexibility – Allows passing different arguments dynamically
